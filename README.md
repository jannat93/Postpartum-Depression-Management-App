# Postpartum-Depression-Management-App
Our project focuses on a mobile app to detect, manage, and support postpartum depression (PPD). Classified as a major depressive episode with peripartum onset (DSM-5), PPD can occur during pregnancy or within a year after childbirth. The app will offer screening, management tools, and helpful resources.
